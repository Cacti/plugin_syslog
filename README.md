# syslog

The syslog plugin is a Cacti plugin that has been around for more than a decade.  It was inspired by the 'aloe' and 'h.aloe' plugins originally developed by the Cacti users sidewinder and Harlequin in the early 2000's.  As you will be able to see from the ChangeLog, it has undergone several changes throughout the years, and remains, even today when you have enterprise offering from both Elastic and Splunk, remains a relevant plugin for small to medium sized companies.

It provides a simple Syslog event search an Alert generation and notification interface that can generate both HTML and SMS messages for operations personnel who wish to receive notifications inside of a data or network operations center.

When combined by the Linux SNMPTT package, it can be converted into an SNMP Trap and Inform receiver and notification engine as the SNMPTT tool will receive SNMP Traps and Informs and convert them into Syslog messages on your log server.  These syslog messages can then be consumed by the syslog plugin.  So, this tool is quite handy.

For log events that continue to be generated frequently on a device, such as smartd's feature to notify every 15 minutes of an impending drive failure, can be quieted using syslog's 'Re-Alert' setting.

## Features

* Message filter
* Message search
* Output to screen or file
* Date time picker
* Event Alerter
* Event Removal (for Events you don't want to see)
* Filter events by Cacti Graph window from Cacti's Graph View pages
* Use of native MySQL and MariaDB database partitioning for larger installs
* Remote Log Server connection capabilities
* Custom column mappings between Remote Log Server and required Syslog columns

## Installation

To install the syslog plugin, simply copy the plugin_sylog directory to Cacti's plugins directory and rename it to simply 'syslog'. Once you have done this, goto Cacti's Plugin Management page, and Install and Enable the plugin. Once this is complete, you can grant users permission to view syslog messages, as well as create Alert, Removal and Report Rules.

If you are upgrading to 2.0 from a prior install, you must first uninstall syslog and insure both the syslog, syslog_removal, and syslog_incoming tables are removed, and recreated at install time.

In addtion, the rsyslog configuration has changed in 2.0.  So, for example, to configure modern rsyslog for Cacti, you must create a file called cacti.conf in the /etc/rsyslog.d/ directory that includes the following:

	--------------------- start /etc/rsyslog.d/cacti.conf ---------------------

	$ModLoad imudp
	$UDPServerRun 514
	$ModLoad ommysql

	$template cacti_syslog,"INSERT INTO syslog_incoming(facility_id, priority_id, program, date, time, host, message) \ 
    values (%syslogfacility%, %syslogpriority%, '%programname%', '%timereported:::date-mysql%', '%timereported:::date-mysql%', '%HOSTNAME%', TRIM('%msg%'))", SQL

	*.* >localhost,my_database,my_user,my_password;cacti_syslog

	--------------------- end /etc/rsyslog.d/cacti.conf ---------------------

Ensure you restart rsyslog after these changes are completed.  Other logging servers such as Syslog-NG are also supported with this plugin.

We are using the pure integer values that rsyslog provides to both the priority and facility in this version syslog, which makes the data collection must less costly for the database.  We have also started including the 'program' syslog column for searching and storage and alert generation.

To setup log forwarding from your network switches and routers, and from your various Linux, UNIX, and other operating system devices, please see their respective documentation.

## Possible Bugs and Feature Enhancements

Bug and feature enhancements for the syslog plugin are handled in GitHub. If you find a first search the Cacti forums for a solution before creating an issue in GitHub.

## Authors

The sylog plugin has been in development for well over a decade with increasing functionality and stibility over that time. There have been several contributors to thold over the years. Chief amonst them are Jimmy Conner, Larry Adams, SideWinder, and Harlequin. We hope that version 2.0 and beyond are the most stable and robust versions of syslog ever published. We are always looking for new ideas. So, this won't be the last release of syslog, you can rest assured of that.
